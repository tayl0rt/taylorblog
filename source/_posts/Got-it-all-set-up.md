## Hello There!

This is basically taylorthompson.net part deux, sans a lot of dead weight (in my opinion.) For what I use a blog for it just made more sense to get off of WordPress, when my focus is really JavaScript and Node.js offers a static generated blogging platform - Hexo.io

If you're unfamiliar with Node.js then you may want to consider watching a presentation or two and reading through the docs. It's built on the V8 JS engine that lives inside of Chrome. Node.js is a very powerful platform from which you can build a wide variety of things. Node's focus is on a single thread that handles all I/O.

Node.js operates on an event loop, instead of threads, and Node kind of exploits the fact that servers can continue to perform operations while handling the I/O requests. I won't go into a lot of Node detail, I have a lot to learn and it's a lot to explain haha.

The biggest focus for me as a developer right now is Angular! Please check out Angular by Google to learn more, it's a wonderful framework and there's a lot of buzz in the community right now for it.

More to come!
