## Hello There!

This is basically taylorthompson.net part deux, sans a lot of dead weight (in my opinion.) For what I use a blog for it just made more sense to get off of WordPress, when my focus is really JavaScript and Node.js offers a static generated blogging platform - Hexo.io

If you're unfamiliar with Node.js then you may want to consider watching a presentation or two and reading through the docs. It's built on the V8 JS engine that lives inside of Chrome. Node.js is a very powerful platform from which you can build a wide variety of things. Node's focus is on a single thread that handles all calls and responses.
